# Stack Implementations in Java

This repository contains stack implementations using Java. It includes programs for converting postfix expressions to infix, prefix expressions to postfix, and evaluating expressions using stacks. Each operation demonstrates the use of stack data structures to handle expression parsing and evaluation. The project is built using Java and is intended to help understand stack-based problem-solving techniques. You can open the project in IntelliJ IDEA and run the Java files containing the `main()` method to test different functionalities.
